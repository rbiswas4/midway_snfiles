This directory contains directories of sim_input files that are working on midway with some version of SNANA. Each of these directories should include a README.md which should list:
- actual purpose of this directory 
- the version of SNANA that it was last tested on
- The location on midway where these files might be found.
 It is expected that these will be tested on newer versions of SNANA periodically, and the README will be updated.

This setup will ultimately have templates and scripts that should reproduce this working files (with no extra comments or spaces) with certain input arguments, and this will be used to test the templates and scripts.
